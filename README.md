Hello, I’m JessMcK. I’m interested in coding, art, music, writing, and graphic design.

My primary focus at present is on my Research Masters in Information Technology, and on my work as a freelance web developer.

At present I'm not very active on GitHub since I don't have many original coding / game project ideas, though I wish I did! ;-)
